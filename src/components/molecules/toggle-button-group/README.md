# Toggle Button Group

The Toggle Button Group displays a group of related [Toggle Buttons](/components/detail/button--toggle-button/) using flexbox. The parent element must have a class of `.toggle-group` and the buttons must be the direct descendants of the parent element.

When a group of related Toggle Buttons are siblings (children of the same parent element), toggling the `pressed` state of one Toggle Button to `true` will set the `pressed` state of all the other buttons to `false`.
